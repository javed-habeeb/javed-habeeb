# Hey there 👋 I'm Javed Habeeb

🎓 I'm an incoming Electronics & Communication Engineering (ECE) undergrad  
🔭 Currently learning Blockchain & Ethereum development  
🌱 I recently started my journey with Python and Smart Contracts  
🧠 I'm diving into Solidity, web3.py, and full-stack dApp building  
📚 Currently following "Blockchain A-Z" and shifting to modern tools like Hardhat & Foundry  
⚡ Fun fact: I like systems that actually solve things, not just exist on paper

## 🔧 Tech I'm Learning

- Solidity
- Python (core + web3.py)
- JavaScript (next: React + ethers.js)
- Git & GitHub
- Smart contract frameworks (Hardhat/Brownie)
- unix basics

## 🚀 My Goals for 2026

- Contribute to at least 1 real-world Web3 open-source project
- Publish 3+ smart contracts with working frontends
- Document everything I build — from noob mistakes to dApp demos
- Intern remotely in Web3 by 2nd year
- Apply for ETHGlobal or other hackathons
